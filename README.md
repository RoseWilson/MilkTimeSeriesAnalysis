# MilkTimeSeriesAnalysis
Cheese Production is really interesting. Based on USDA data, has cheese production been impacted in 2020?

This project was completed in fall 2020 for the Time Series Analysis class at Siena College.
Can we use past data to predict future production? Can we utilize this analysis to determine if 2020 has impacted production?
Also can we notice any seasonality in milk production and why?
